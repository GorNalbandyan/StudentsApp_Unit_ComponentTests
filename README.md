# Study Group Application Test Cases

This repository contains unit and component test cases for the Study Group application. The tests cover various functionalities of the application to ensure that it behaves as expected.

## Unit Test Cases

The unit test cases focus on testing individual components (e.g., methods, functions) of the application in isolation. These tests verify the correctness of the implementation and behavior of specific units of code.

### Test Case Structure

- **Test Case Name**: A descriptive name for the test case.
- **Description**: A brief description of the test case.
- **Arrange**: Setup phase where necessary objects and dependencies are initialized.
- **Act**: Execution phase where the method or function under test is invoked.
- **Assert**: Validation phase where the outcome of the test is verified against expected results.

### Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `StudentsApp/StudnetsApp.Tests/UnitTests` directory.
3. Execute the unit test suite using your preferred testing framework (e.g., NUnit).

## Component Test Cases

The component test cases focus on testing the interaction and integration of multiple units or components within the application. These tests ensure that different parts of the application work together correctly.

### Test Case Structure

- **Test Case Name**: A descriptive name for the test case.
- **Description**: A brief description of the test case.
- **Scenario**: The scenario being tested, including any preconditions.
- **Action**: The actions taken during the test.
- **Expected Outcome**: The expected outcome or behavior of the application.

### Running Component Tests

To run the component tests:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `StudentsApp/StudnetsApp.Tests/ComponentTests` directory.
3. Execute the component test suite using your preferred testing framework (e.g., NUnit).
