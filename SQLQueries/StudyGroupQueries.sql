--The query assumes the presence of both UserId and Name columns in the Users table. We make this assumption to enable the join operation between 
--the StudyGroups and Users tables based on the UserId column, and to filter the results based on the Name column. This assumption allows us to retrieve 
--study groups that have at least one associated user whose name starts with 'M'. While we acknowledge that specific database schema may vary, 
--this assumption is made based on typical conventions for representing users in relational databases.
